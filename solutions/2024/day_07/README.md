# Day 7 (2024)

`Bridge Repair` ([prompt](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/7))

When in doubt, brute force! I generated a list of all possible combinations of each line and processed them all until I found one that worked. 

## Part 1

The hardest part was figuring out the best return type for my recursive function. I tried a list of lists but couldn't get the list extenstion to work the way I wanted. Then I figured a string for each equation would be easier. 

## Part 2

Part 2 was actually pretty simple. I was easy to implement the new operator. Most of my time on this part was actually just remaking the functions I wrote in part 1 to work for both parts.
